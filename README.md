# PuriGuard
PuriGuard is an AI-powered content scanner that detects NSFW (Not Safe for Work) material from URLs, text, and images. Built with TensorFlow and Flask, it optionally triggers a prank (like a fake BSOD) when explicit content is detected. Designed for content filtering, monitoring, or creative deterrence.
